6. tips

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. install apache

   if you don't know how to do, read the INSTALL manual in the apache 
   distribution. it is important, that you turn on dynamic modules support. this
   can be done by use any of the --enable-shared option, or at least include the
   mod_so module with the --enable-module=so option. read the INSTALL manual for
   more detail.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. install the dispatcher module

   the dispatcher module come as binary form for every supported platform. the
   file has the following naming structure:
     dispatcher_apache_xxxx_yyyy.so
   where xxxx is the version number, and yyyy the target platform and version.
   place the dispatcher module in your module directory which is usually the
   $(APACHE_ROOT)/libexec directory. for easier handling, create a symbolic
   link named 'mod_dispatcher.so' to the dispatcher module:
   > ln -s dispatcher_apache_xxxx_yyyy.so mod_dispatcher.so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. configure the httpd.conf

   please take also a look at the distributed httpd.conf.disp

   to get the dispatcher module recognized by apache, you have to add it to the
   modules section of the httpd.conf of apache.
   
     .
     .   
     # Example:
     # LoadModule foo_module libexec/mod_foo.so
     .
     .
     LoadModule dispatcher_module  libexec/mod_dispatcher.so
   
   then add some dispatcher configuariton tags:
   
     .
     .
     # configure the minimal setting for the dispatcher
     # the main configuration is read from the 'DispatcherConfig' file.
     #
     <IfModule disp_apache2.c>
       # location of the configuration file. eg: 'conf/dispatcher.any'
       DispatcherConfig conf/dispatcher.any

       # location of the dispatcher log file. eg: 'logs/dispatcher.log'
       DispatcherLog    logs/dispatcher.log 
  
       # log level for the dispatcher log, can be either specified
       # as a string or an integer (in parentheses)
       # error(0): Errors
       # warn(1):  Warnings
       # info(2):  Infos
       # debug(3): Debug
       DispatcherLogLevel debug
       
       # if turned on, the dispatcher looks like a normal module
       # since build 5210, this setting has no effect, since it used to crash
       # apache if set to 0.
       DispatcherNoServerHeader On
  
       # if turned on, request to / are not handled by the dispatcher
       # use the mod_alias then for the correct mapping
       DispatcherDeclineRoot Off
     </IfModule>
     .
     .

   now depeding of your needs, add the 'dispatcher-handler' to you appropriate
   directory or location directive. the simplest case is just use the dispatcher
   for the entire site, so just modify the / directory directive:

     .
     .
     <Directory />

       <IfModule disp_apache2.c>    
         # enable dispatcher for ALL request. if this is too restrictive,     
         # move it to another location
         SetHandler dispatcher-handler
       </IfModule>

       Options FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride None
     </Directory>
     .
     .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. configure dispatcher.any

   place the dispatcher.any also in the conf directory, or wherever you 
   configured it in the httpd.conf by the DispatcherConfig parameter. the 
   dispatcher can handle serveral 'render-farms' which are addressable by the
   hostname (virtual hosts). every 'farm' consists of one or more renders, over
   which the load is balanced. you need at least 1 render per farm. for every
   farm you must specify the load-balancing statistic criteria and an optional
   caching configuration. please see the full dispatcher documentation for
   details of this configuration. 
   the following will just mention the minimal changes to the given 
   dispatcher.any which have to be done to get the dispatcher running:
   
   1: adapt the hostname of the system where the render is running
   2: adapt the port where the render is bound
   3: configure the cachedirectory for this farm. please note, that this must be
      the same as the 'DocumentRoot' in the httpd.conf and that the user which
      runs the httpd must have read and write permissions.
   
   !!Please note, that since version 1.2, the dispatcher has a new config!!
   
      [...] 

      /renders
        {
        /rend01
          {
[1]-->    /hostname "localhost"
[2]-->    /port "80"
          }
        }
      /cache
        {
[3]-->  /docroot "/opt/communique/dispatcher/cache"
        
      [...] 
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. remove MultiViews option in dispatcher handled directories

   when a file is requested and its parent directory does not yet exist, the
   negotation module returns a 403 (FORBIDDEN) before the dispatcher has the
   opportunity to create the file and its parent directories. you should 
   therefore disable the MultiViews option inside directories that are handled 
   by the dispatcher.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. tips

   - on first installtion set the loglevel to 3
   - after starting apache, consult the 'error_log' of apache and the 
     'dispatcher_log' if apache and dispatcher started correctly.
     the error_log should say something like:
       [Thu May 30 05:16:36 2002] [notice] Apache/2.0.50 (Unix) configured
     and the dispatcher_log something like:
       [Fri Jan 19 17:22:16 2001] [I] [19096] Dispatcher initialized (build XXXX)
   
   - surf the website through the apache and look if everything looks fine
   - take a look at the cachedirectory and check if it gets filled
   - activate a page and check, if the cache gets flushed correctly.
   - if everything looks fine, you can reduce the loglevel to 0 again
